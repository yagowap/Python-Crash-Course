Day 01 - After Creating Accounts for AWS, Slack, and Github.  I need a easy browser-based-zero-footprint IDE for python.  
            The AWS Cloud9 IDE wouldnt start properly for my computer.  

Notes format:
  ppXXX: <- "pp" means Book page, "XXX" is the page number, and COLON is a delimiter. 
	
	
	pp017 Variables -  My first program is hello_world.py
